# Employee-Tracker
This Employee Tracker project will allow a user to be able to easily view departments, roles, and employees within a company, displayed with handy tables. This program uses mysql2, and inquirer, which will both require installs by the user. This can easily be done w/ npm i inquirer@8, and npm i mysql2 within the terminal. The user is prompted upon running the server.js file using command node server.js, and will be prompted w/ choices to view all departments, roles, employees, or to add departments, role, employee, or update an existing employees role.
The project can absolutely continue to be refined, instead of having the user need to input role ID's or department ID's for building new employees and roles respectively, we should be able to add a feature where a user can choose from selections instead, making it easier for the user to select their desired role and department ID's without having to reference the tables generated by the program.
